        <h3>ArtFixPro terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              ArtFixPro contracts with third-party, independent contractors
              ("Contractor") selected by ArtFixPro to carry out the Services.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              ArtFixPro and the Contractor have an independent contractor
              relationship.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              ArtFixPro diligently screens and selects only skilled
              Contractors who meet the background check and qualification
              requirements and adhere to its standards.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              As applicable, ArtFixPro will provide the Contractor with the
              required information to schedule the Services at your location
              on time. The Contractor is accountable for arranging the
              scheduled services with the Customer. It is important to note
              that scheduled Service dates may be subject to modification
              due to factors beyond the Contractor's control, such as
              inclement weather or other unforeseeable circumstances.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              As ArtFixPro, we regret to inform you that we do not offer any
              haul away or moving services. We kindly request that you
              ensure your item is in the desired room or location before our
              appointment for assembly or installation. If the appointment
              must be canceled due to the need for moving services, a
              cancellation charge will be applied.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Once the job is completed, our technician is only authorized
              to dispose of any trash by placing it in your property's
              designated trash bin. Please note that our technician is not
              authorized to haul away or remove any trash or packaging
              materials from your property.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Customer Terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The customer must ensure that a responsible adult who is at
              least 18 years of age or older will be present at the
              residence during the performance of the services. This
              individual will be authorized by the customer to sign off upon
              completion of the services.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Our company requires that customers choose the assembly or
              service location and ensure that all packages, items, or
              materials are in the designated area. It is the responsibility
              of the customer to prepare the location in advance of the
              contractor's arrival.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Please be aware that our contractors are not responsible for
              moving any package, assembled or mounted item, or any
              material.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Clearing the way to your desired location is essential to
              allow the Contractor to safely provide the Services. Please
              ensure that there are no obstacles, such as furniture or
              personal belongings, that would impede their path.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It is requested that the customer does not open the item boxes
              before the technician arrives. If the customer chooses to do
              so, the company cannot accept responsibility and liability for
              any missing or damaged parts. If this occurs after the
              technician has already visited the property, there will be a
              $30 travel fee.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In case the customer has any extra service during the
              appointment or further service requests, claims, or
              complaints, they are advised to contact ArtFixPro in writing
              using the number (917) 498-1863
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              As part of our commitment to providing high-quality services,
              we require that customers complete a final inspection of any
              services that have been delivered by our contractors.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              However, if there are any issues with the services at the time
              of the provision of services, we require that you notify us in
              writing by email or text to our company’s number (917) 498-1863. This allows us to address any issues promptly and
              ensure your complete satisfaction. You have 90 days warranty
              for the service.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>

              this policy. Our goal is to provide you with the best possible
              service and ensure that you are completely satisfied with the

              Under no circumstances shall ArtFixPro total liability to you,
              whether based on contract, tort, or otherwise, exceed the
              amount you paid ArtFixPro for the services. Please note that
              some states do not allow the limitation or release of certain
              damages or liability. Therefore, the above limitation of
              liability and release may not apply to you. At ArtFixPro, we
              strive to provide our customers with satisfactory services and
              appreciate your understanding of our limitations of liability
              and release.

        <li>
          <p>
            We stand behind the quality of our services and offer a 90-day
            limited warranty on all services provided. We warrant that the
            services will be free from any defect in workmanship for 90 days
            from the date of completion.

        </li>
        <li>

            Please note that this limited warranty does not cover damage
            from acts or occurrences beyond the reasonable control of
            ArtFixPro or its contractors, including but not limited to,
            strikes, lockouts, insurrections, war, riots, and acts of God
            such as flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, microbursts,
            windstorms, electrical outages, fires, pandemics, and epidemics.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Additionally, this limited warranty does not cover any defects
            in the manufacture, design, merchantability, or fitness for a
            particular purpose of any of the goods for which the services
            are being provided. Such defects may be covered by others under
            any warranty provided by the manufacturer or seller of the
            goods.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the event of any warranty claim, ArtFixPro reserves the right

      <div>
        <h3>Payment Terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              By signing the invoice or paying its due balance, Client
              hereby acknowledges that all requested service items for this
              date and/or any other dates listed in the description section
              of the invoice, have been performed and have been tested
              showing successful satisfactory results. By accepting this
              invoice, the Client confirms the completion of the project,
              hence releases and discharges the Service Provider of refund,
              dispute, or money-back requests. By accepting this invoice,
              the Client agrees to pay in full the amount listed in the
              Total section of the invoice.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Payment is due at the time of service unless otherwise agreed
              upon in writing. We accept debit or credit cards, Apple Pay,
              Cash App, and PayPal payments. If payment is not received
              within 3 days of the service date, we reserve the right to
              assess late fees and interest charges.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Cancellation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              At ArtFixPro, we understand that plans can change, and we
              strive to provide flexibility for our customers. According to
              our cancellation policy, you can cancel your scheduled
              appointment without incurring any penalty if you do so at
              least 24 hours before the appointment time. However, please
              note that if you cancel within 24 hours of the appointment, a
              cancellation fee of $20 will apply. Additionally, if you
              decide to cancel while the technician is at your location or
              during the appointment time frame, a $30 fee or a partial
              service fee will be charged.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If payment was made before the service and for any reason the
              service cannot be completed, it is common practice to offer a
              full refund to the customer. This is generally seen as fair
              and reasonable, as the customer has not received the service
              they paid for. Please note that there is no refund after the
              service has been executed. However, to maintain the quality
              standards and benchmarks we have set, we offer our valuable
              customers a 90-day warranty on all our services. Within 90
              days of our service, if any issue arises, we'll fix the
              problem for you with no extra charges.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Non-Payment Policy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            At ArtFixPro, we take our business operations seriously and
            require timely payment for the services we provide. Failure to
            pay for services rendered may have serious consequences,
            including damage to credit records and a negative impact on a
            customer's background check.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a customer does not pay for services rendered, we will send a
            reminder notice requesting payment. If payment is not received
            within 1-3 days of the reminder notice, we may take legal action
            to collect the debt, including but not limited to turning the
            matter over to a collection agency or pursuing legal action in a
            court of law. Any legal or collection fees incurred because of
            non-payment will be the responsibility of the customer.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Dispute Policy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            We aim to deliver excellent services and prioritize your
            satisfaction. We offer a 90-day warranty and will address any
            issues without additional charges. If you dispute the
            transaction, we may take legal action to defend our interests.
            New service requests after the warranty period are considered
            separate. After you confirm satisfaction, payment is expected,
            and no refunds are offered. Fraud or scamming will result in
            legal action, and background checks may be conducted. Please
            provide accurate information to avoid any issues.
